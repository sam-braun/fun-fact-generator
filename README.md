# Fun Fact Generator

This Fun Fact Generator is a simple web application that allows users to fetch and display random fun facts about subjects including science, literature, philosophy, and more.

## How It Works

1. When the page loads, you will see a title ("Fun Fact Generator") and a button (labeled "Get Fun Fact").
2. Clicking the "Get Fun Fact" button triggers an AJAX request to an external API that provides random fun facts.
3. The API response is processed, and the displayed fun fact text alternates between different colors for each fact.
4. The fact container will display the fetched fun fact along with the alternating text color.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structuring the web page.
- CSS: Styling the page elements and applying formatting.
- JavaScript (jQuery): Handling button click events, making AJAX requests, and updating the page content.
- [API-Ninjas API](https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/facts): External API used to fetch random fun facts.

## Credits
