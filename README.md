# Fun Fact Generator

This Fun Fact Generator is a simple web application that allows users to fetch and display random fun facts about subjects including science, literature, philosophy, and more.

## How It Works

1. When the page loads, you will see a title ("Fun Fact Generator") and a button (labeled "Get Fun Fact").
2. Clicking the "Get Fun Fact" button triggers an AJAX request to an external API that provides random fun facts.
3. The API response is processed, and the displayed fun fact text alternates between different colors for each fact.
4. The fact container will display the fetched fun fact along with the alternating text color.

## How to Install and Run the Project

1. Create an [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com) account and retrieve your API key.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone git@github.com:sam-braun/fun-fact-generator.git`

## Credits

The random fun facts are sources from the [API Ninjas Facts API](https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/facts).
